        h1 Hi, who are you?
        p.st Oh thank you, how nice of you to ask! I'm Julius, a computer science student from Dresden, Germany. In my free time I do Orienteering, play from time to time my bass guitar to annoy my neighbours and travel way too often.
        h2 How can I contact you?
        p If you feel like I can help you somehow feel free to choose from the following list:
        ul
            li E-Mail: #[a(href="mailto:julius@gaenseri.ch") julius@gaenseri.ch]
            li Linkedin: #[a(href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julius-gonsior-2790b3141/") Julius Gonsior] 
            li GitHub: #[a(href="https://github.com/jgonsior") jgonsior]
            li Telegram: #[a(href="https://telegram.me/jgonsior") jgonsior] 
            li Twitter: #[a(href="https://twitter.com/juliusgonsior") juliusgonsior]
            li XMPP: #[a(href="xmpp://julius@ifsr.de") julius@ifsr.de]

        p If you want to make me happy please use my PGP key published at #[a(href="https://keybase.io/jgonsior/sigs/LfZ5xSVadUUkVYLj9NxNEEX5iz1e1cLUDrBf") keybase.io].

        h2 What the heck does gaenseri.ch mean?
        p Well, my last name is #[i Gonsior] which is a Germanized form of the polish word #[i Gasior] which translates to #[i Gander], so a male goose. And because little Julius in 2012 thought it would be nice to have a domain where the TLD is part of the spoken domain name, he choose a German translation of Gander, Gänserich. And because Unicode is so damn hard, I chose to replace the #[i ä] vowel with #[i ae].

        h2 If you're a programmer, any interesting projects you'd like to brag about?
        p Well, normally I wouldn't talk about it, but when you ask so kindly…
        h3 #[a(href="https://github.com/Wikidata/QueryAnalysis") Wikidata SPARQL Query Analysis]
        p Currently I'm a student research assistant in the #[a(href="https://iccl.inf.tu-dresden.de/web/Wissensbasierte_Systeme/en") Knowledge-Based Systems] group led by Prof. Markus Krötzsch. We're analysing the SPARQL query logs of Wikidata, more information can be found #[a(href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Understanding_Wikidata_Queries") here].
        h3 #[a(href="https://github.com/jgonsior/AngryProgrammers") Angry Programmers]
        p Together with #[a(href="https://github.com/Richie94") Richard] we both tried to solve #[i Angry Birds] with the help of Reinforcement Learning as part of the #[a(href="http://aibirds.org") Angry Birds AI Competition]. Unfortunately we discovered, that the version of Angry Birds we were provided for the Contest, was way too slow to generate enough training data to solve it properly. So in the end this project can be considered as a failure. 
        h3 #[a(href="https://github.com/jgonsior/photok") Photok]
        p During my ERASMUS year in Linköping, Sweden I developed together with #[a(href="https://github.com/laurentfite") Laurent] and #[a(href="https://github.com/sijmenw") Sijmen] a photo contest application with Flask, Angular and all the other fancy Web Development tools which were popular at this time .

        h2 One last thing, do you want to thank someone?
        p Well, one last thing.Without the help of #[a(href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/") http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/], #[a(href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/")  http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/] and finally #[a(href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/") https://thebestmotherfucking.website/] this website would be just a piece of ordinary shit.
        p And a huge applause to the most talented animal drawer I know, #[a(href="https://www.reddit.com/user/DyedKitty") u/DyedKitty]. All credits for the wonderful goose drawing go to him :)
