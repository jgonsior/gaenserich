And because little Julius in 2012 thought it would be nice to have a domain where the top-level domain is part of the spoken domain name, he choose a German translation of Gander, Gänserich. Later then he discovered that Unicode in top-level domains  will probably never happen, so he chose to replace the <i>&auml;</i> vowel with <i>ae</i>."

Good luck a good friend of mine just started this totally awesome and adventurous sounding sport called <i>Orienteering</i> and dragged me along to the training. Bascially you've got a map and a compass, and then you need to find pre-marked spots in the forest. It's like cross-country running, but you're playing chess meanwhile. I immediately fell in love with the sport, and since then I got so addicted to it that it kinda influenced some of the biggest decisions in my previous years: orienteering was one of many reasons, but in the end the decisive one, for me to move for studying to Germanys orienteering centre Dresden, and it is no surprise either, that I spent my Erasmus year in the founding country of orienteering, in Sweden.",

Our plan was to use Reinforcement Learning to train our agent. Unfortunately we discovered, instead of solving the game properly, that the implementation of the game, with which we've been provided by the competition, wasn't suited for any type of Machine Learning. It took us around one week to play only 3.000 levels, even after months of fine-tuning and optimization. For proper Q-Learning you need way more training iterations, so after some months we decided that we should reimplement the game instead - and that we don't have the time for that, so we abandoned this project.",
